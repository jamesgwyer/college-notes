# Collection of Resources

## On this site
So far I have made a page for each of the three major content sections on the course and what you need to know for that section. You can view all these "[summaries](/summaries)" here:
- [Core Units exams summary](/summaries/core-units)
- [Employer Set Project task summaries](/summaries/employer-set-project)
- [Occupational Specialism project summary](/summaries/occupational-specialism) (currently unfinished)

Along with this I've added a "[Spec](/spec/core-unit-1)" section for all the boring bits (what you actually get marked on).

I also have a collection of past papers which you can view on [this page](/past-papers).
