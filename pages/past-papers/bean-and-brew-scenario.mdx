# Bean & Brew

Bean & Brew is a practice Occupational Specialism scenario created by Pearson to give students an idea of what the brief in the real exam could look like. I've re-uploaded the document [here](/osc/BandB_Brief.pdf) for easy access.

## Project Scenario
![Project scenario](/osc/BandB_Scenario.png)

## What you need to do

### Task 1
In task 1, you need to "produce a detailed proposal for the digital solution required by the client, and all current and new customers" and "produce a set of design documents for the digital solution that you are proposing".

#### Proposal
1. Your proposal should provide a rationale
2. The functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
3. A full list of the problems that need to be solved to meet all requirements
4. The key performance indicators (KPIs) and user acceptance criteria for the proposed solution
5. A full description of the proposed solution

> You should also justify how the recommended solution meets the needs of the client and users and how potential risks will be mitigated. You should also cover how relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements will be met.

#### Design Documents
The design documentation you create must include:
- Data requirements
- Interface designs
- Potential algorithmic solutions
- A testing strategy (does not need to cover all the tests required but should provide a selection of the required tests and an overview of the proposed solution)

> The solution you identify must be of enough complexity to demonstrate the ability to code and **implement it in at least two languages** that would be able to handle both front and back end processes.

The design documentation should contain enough detail to:
- Clearly allow the client to make an informed decision on the project
- Be able to communicate the solution to technical and non-technical stakeholders
- Allow an outside developer to use the documents to build the solution
- Demonstrate the algorithm designs of most sections

### Task 2
