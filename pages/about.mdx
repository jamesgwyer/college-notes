# About

"college-notes" is a site I made to publish all the resources I could possibly find about my course (because they're really hard to find). Using the [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app) library (in particular their "docs theme"), the is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and allows me to easily create and edit content in Markdown. If you're interested, the code is on Github [here](https://github.com/jgwyr/college-notes).

### What is the course?
A “T-Level” is a new technical qualification in the UK supposed to be worth the equivalent of 3 A-Level’s. The course is made up of four main components; [2 core unit exams](/summaries/core-units-exams), [5 “Employer Set Project” tasks](/summaries/employer-set-project), a [67 hour “Occupational Specialist” project](/summaries/occupational-specialism), and 315 hours (roughly 45 days) worth of [industry-related work experience](/work-experience).
