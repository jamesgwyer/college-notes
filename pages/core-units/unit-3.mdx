# 3 - Emerging Issues and Impact of Digital

```
Students should be able to apply an understanding of ethical and moral issues in the digital sector in a range of business contexts. They should explore how developments in technology impact on organisations, individuals and society as a whole. Students should be aware of the ever-developing nature of digital technologies, and keep up to date with knowledge of important and innovative developments in the sector.
