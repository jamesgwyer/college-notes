# Past Papers Archive

An archive of past papers that are (mostly) publicly available. You can download everything locally by going to [the repo on Github](https://github.com/jamesgwyer/college-notes) and clicking the "Download ZIP" option in the "Code" dropdown.

I'm not actually sure if I'm meant to make this public but it is really helpful so I'm going to do it anyway.

### Bean & Brew Scenario

Bean & Brew is a practice Occupational Specialism scenario created by Pearson to give students an idea of what the brief in the real exam could look like. I've re-uploaded the document [here](/osc/BandB_Brief.pdf) for easy access.
