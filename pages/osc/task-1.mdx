# Task 1 - Analysing the problem and designing a solution

## Produce a detailed proposal for the digital solution required by the client
1. Your proposal should provide a rationale
2. The functional and non-functional requirements of the solution
3. A full list of the problems that need to be solved to meet all the requirements
4. The key performance indicators (KPI's) and user acceptance criteria for the proposed solution
5. A full description of the proposed solution

You should also justify how your solution meets the needs of the clients and users and how potential risks will be mitigated. You should also cover how relevant regulatory guidelines and legal requirements will be met.

## Produce a set of design documents for the digital solution that you are proposing
The design documentation must include:
- data requirements
- interface designs
- potential algorithmic solutions
- testing strategy

The design documentation should contain enough detail to:
- clearly allow the client to make an informed decision on the project
- be able to communicate the solution to technical and non-technical stakeholders
- allow an outside developer to use the documents to build the solution
- demonstrate the algorithm designs of most sections

The testing strategy does not need to cover all the tests required but should provide a selection of the required tests and an overview of the proposed solution. It should also show: the testing order and the required types of tests.
