# Task 2 - Developing a prototype design solution

## Develop a functional prototype of your digital solution

During the development you must:
- implement front-end and back-end processes using at least two coding languages
- create, find, and utilise appropriate graphics
- document the reiterative process
- document iterative testing
- produce the maintainable code
- develop a quality user experience
- make sure all regulatory and legal guidelines are followed

## Develop a log of what you have been doing
This log needs to contain:
- records of the solutions
- descriptions of the content and purpose
- records of the date you retrieved the information

## Create a testing plan and log
Your testing documentation does not need to detail all tests carried out but should demonstrate (using appropriate test data):
- an iterative approach to testing
- a full understanding of how to test
- inputs
- calculations
- validation
- processes
