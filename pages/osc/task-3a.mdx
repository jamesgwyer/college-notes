# Task 3a - Gathering feedback to inform future developments

## Produce a plan for how you intend to gather feedback
Your plan should include appropriate audiences and types of demonstrations that will need to be conducted in order to provide assurance to the client that the product will meet their requirements.

## Evaluate your prototype's functionality
(using your finished prototype and appropriate tools, methods and techniques prepare and carryout a series of demonstrations)

Your demonstrations must be for a technical audience (e.g. programming professionals), and a non-technical audience (e.g. the client, the users).

## Gather and record feedback in a suitable way that will allow it to be analysed
