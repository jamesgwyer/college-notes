# Task 3b - Evaluating feedback to inform future developments

This task is actually quite similar to [the last task of the ESP](/esp/task-4b) where you have to evaluate your work.

### Explain how your solution meets the clients requirements and KPI's
- how effective the content and assets are in meeting the needs of the client
- explain the reliability and validity of the sources of information you used that were not created by you
- analyse and describe any legal and ethical implications of the assets and content selected

### Talk through the design solution and recommend ways it could be further developed
Your presentation should contain ways to prevent and identify foreseeable issues such as:
- changes to the regulatory requirements
- changes in business processes
- compatibility with new technology
