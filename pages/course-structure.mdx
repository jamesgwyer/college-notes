# How the course works

Just like other T-Levelâ€™s, this course is made up of four different sections that combine to create your final grade:

- [2 Core Unit Exams](#core-units)
- [Employer Set Project](#employer-set-project)
- [Occupational Specialism](#occupational-specialism)
- [Work Experience](#work-experience)

The Core Unit exams and Employer Set Project grades are combined to find an average, which makes up 33% of your grade. Then the Occupational Specialism and Work Experience are worth 33% each.

## Core Units

There are 8 core units which these exams are based upon (Units 1-4 for Paper 1, 5-8 for Paper 2). I have created seperate pages detailing the spec of each unit linked below:

| Paper 1 (2hr 30min) | Paper 2 (2hr 30min) |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| 1. [Problem Solving](/core-units/unit-1)  | 5. [Business Context](/core-units/unit-5) |
| 2. [Introduction to Programming](/core-units/unit-2) | 6. [Data](/core-units/unit-6) |
| 3. [Emerging Issues and Impact of Digital](/core-units/unit-3) | 7. [Digital Environments](/core-units/unit-7) |
| 4. [Legislation and Regulatory Requirements](/core-units/unit-4) | 8. [Security](/core-units/unit-8) |

Paper 1 is titled "Digital Analysis, Legislation, and Emerging Issues" and Paper 2 "The Business Environment". These papers are worth a combined total of 100 marks. Your score/grade on this exam is then combined with that of the [ESP](#employer-set-project) to create 1/3 of your final grade.

## Employer Set Project

Beginning with a (roughly) one week long "familiarisation period", pre-release information is given to colleges and students so that you can begin to research the industry sector of the business you have been given. The week you're given to do this in is very different to an actual exam as to carry out research you will be able to, access the internet, work in groups, and make notes about your research (you of course are not able to bring these notes into the actual exam though).

| Task Number | Focus | Length | Marks |
| :---------- | :---- | :----- | :---- |
| 1           | [Planning a project](/esp/task-1) | 3hrs | 19 |
| 2           | [Identifying and fixing defects in existing code](/esp/task-2) | 3hrs | 21 |
| 3           | [Designing a solution](/esp/task-3) | 3hrs | 17 |
| 4a          | [Developing a solution](/esp/task-4a) | 4hrs | 34 |
| 4b          | [Reflective evaluation](/esp/task-4b) | 1hr 30min | 9 |
