# Task 4b - Reflective evaluation

Task 4b is sort of like the rationale you have to complete in [Task 1](/esp/task-1), you are given read-only copies of the code you created in Task 4a and need to create a reflective evaluation on the code you wrote. The task brief for this exam will also include the system and user requirements you were supposed to meet in Task 4a.

This exam is the shortest in the ESP at just 1 hour 30 mins.

| Requirements | Marks | "Competencies covered" |
| :----------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| Programming outcomes | 6 | |
| Comparison to designs | 3 | |

Whilst writing your evaluation, you need to consider how well your code in the last exam met the system and user requirements and how the solution could be taken further or expanded. You should use and provide specific examples from the brief and your code to exemplify and provide evidence for the points you make.
