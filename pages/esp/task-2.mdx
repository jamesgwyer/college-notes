# Task 2 - Identifying and fixing defects in an existing code

The focus of Task 2 is to identify and fix defects in existing code. At the start of the exam you are given a brief aswell as other material needed like the Non-working code inside of a .txt file (usually on a USB stick). For this task, you need to test and fix the code you're given which relates to the business in question. You're also given a test-logging template on this USB too for you to describe any errors you find and how you fixed them.

The two main requirements for this task are:
| Requirements | Marks | "Competencies covered" |
| :----------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| using testing to identify defects with the non-working code and documenting the testing process including any possible remedial actions to be taken | 12 | E1, E2, M10, D3 |
| producing a working solution based on the results of your testing | 9 | M4, M5, M7 |

Just like Task 1, there are 3 hours allocated to Task 2 which the textbook recommends you split in half to work on each requirement.

## Use of testing to identify defects, and documenting the testing process
After reading through the brief, you will need to analyse the non-working code and create a test plan to identify the issues that are stopping the code from working properly.

When you are testing to identify defects you will need to:
- assess the given code against requirements
- carry out testing to identify issues in the given code
- perform any remedial actions required, justifying any decision made when fixing the defect

The test plan you create, use and amend should cover:
- identify the tests to be carried out
- describe the purpose of the identified test
- identify the test data to be used including valid, valid extreme, invalid, invalid extreme, and erroneous
- describe the expected results
- describe the actual results of the tests performed
- compare the actual results of testing with the actual results
- describe any further actions that are required

"At this stage it is important that you also test the code to make sure it is robust and performs as required. One way of doing this is to do a dry run with values that should produce an error message and that this error message only appears when incorrect values have been input."

On the page "[ESP Exam June 2023](/esp/june-2023)" I have linked a good template for logging tests you do and how you fixed them. It is also available further down this page.

## What you should be looking for
This is a list of typical errors that will more than likely come up in the Non-working code file:
- Missing delimiter (,) *e.g. comma between two list entries*
- Something like an array, function, or variable created/referred to, but then not seen again
- Missing colon (:) *e.g. in the condition of a for loop*
- Logic error *e.g. true when should be false, or checking for == rather than !=*
- Index error *e.g. starting checking an index on 1 rather than 0*
- Wrong item checked for *e.g. checking the length of a variable, when for that test, it should be a different variable being checked*
- Calling the wrong function, or calling a function incorrectly *e.g. my_function, when it should be **my_function()***
- Extra/missing bracket
- Wrong method called *e.g. time.now() rather than **date**time.now()*
- Calculation error *e.g. wrong total being calculated, wrong figure used in calculation*
- Wrong assignment *e.g. = rather than ==*
- Misspelling *e.g. variable or function name misspelled*
- Casting as integer when looking to print as a string
- Data wrongly formatted *e.g. into a single line rather than multiple lines*
- Not converting inputted numbers into integers

## Testing methods
These are some common ways to test how robust/good at error handling the program is. Most suggestions include submitting things into inputs that should come up with an error.
- Inputting negative numbers
- Inputting extremely large numbers, very small numbers (boundary testing)
- Text into numeric inputs
- Numeric inputs in text inputs
- Different date formats *e.g. DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YY*
- Incorrect input *e.g. item not on list of options*
- Manually check calculations that the program outputs
- Check menu options return the right index value *e.g. selecting 1 will return index 0*
- Inputting menu option values outside of the selection offered *e.g. 7 when given options 1-6*
- Checking formatting *e.g. spacing, line breaks (\n), capitalisation etc*
- Testing new items are added to a list correctly

## What your test log will look like and how to use it
I can't actually remember if this is correct, but I'm fairly sure you're actually given this test log in the exam, however if you're not then this is a good example to follow.

| Description of test | Test data to be used (if required) | Expected outcome | Actual outcome | Comments and intended actions |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------- | :--------------- | :------------- | :---------------------------- |
| This is where you would state where the code you're testing is (line, variable name, etc) | If you're testing a variable or another function that already contains data (like a dictionary), this is where you would enter a variable name or what the data is. | Here you would describe what is *supposed* to happen when you run the program. | This is where you describe what *actually* happens when you run the program. | And finally this is where you explain how you fixed the error and what the problem was. |

## The solution
After this, you will need to make the changes to the code and confirm the changes you have made make the code work as intended.
