# Task 1 - Planning a Project

Task 1 focuses on planning the project from the brief you're given in the pre-release/familiarisation period. In the exam you are given a sheet with further details, usually things like financial information for the business, important details about the development team (names, wages, experience), a breakdown of the hours allocated for each task, a list of "assumptions" that have been made (this can be for things like contingency needed for major or minor faults), and the total time allocated to the development.

The three main things you need to do in this exam are to create a Gantt chart (in Microsoft Projects), a costing plan (in Excel), and a Rationale explaining all of the decisions you made in making these.

According to the textbook, it's suggested you use 1 hour of your time for each section. However, you'll probably find it easier to work on the rationale as you create the Gantt chart and costings plan, as then you won't forget any of the details you'd need to justify.

| Requirements | Marks | "Competencies covered" |
| :----------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| Gantt Chart  | 6 | E5, M1, D1                 |
| Resource and Cost Plan | 4 | M8               |
| Rationale | 9 | E5, M9                        |

## Key Terms
- **Milestones**: specific points during a project used to make sure it is on-track. A milestone has no time allocated and it usually occurs at the end of a critical part of the project. It is usually shown as a diamond shape on a Gantt chart.
- **Contingency time**: time built into the schedule for a project which can be used in case of any unforeseen issues, problems, or events.
- **Serial/concurrent tasks**: tasks which can be completed at the same time.

## Gantt chart
When you are creating your Gantt chart you will need to:
- consider the strengths and skills of the development team and assign appropriate tasks to the them - the details of the development team will most likely be given to you in the task brief at the beginning of the exam
- make scheduling decisions in response to a defined deadline - the projected breakdown of hours and the development time will have been provided in the task brief
- priorities activities or tasks based on analysis of requirements - you will need to consider milestones, contingency time, dependent, serial and concurrent tasks, and any task dependencies
- assign resources to project tasks (like employees)
- organise the tasks efficiently

## Resource and Cost Plan
After the Gantt chart is completed, you need to create a plan which covers the resources you will need and their costs. This plan should be created in an Excel compatible spreadsheet and should include:
- required and allocated resources, including which team member(s) will be involved in each task
- the cost of the resources
- an overall estimate of the total cost of the development

When you are creating this plan, you should consider the skills and industry experience of the development team from the task brief. You will need to use the costs for each dev team member that were provided in the task brief.

In the information in the brief, different options may have been provided. A regularly used example of this is when you are given different server options to be considered like *with support or without support* or *cloud-based or physical*. You also need to consider any ongoing costs like the cost of any staff needed or maintenance costs.

## Rationale
Whilst selecting any options and making decisions inside the Gantt chart and Costing plans, you will need to be able to justify your choices as this justification will form part of the final part of this exam - the rationale.

The rationale you create needs to explain the planning approach you took. Some decisions you make that should be highlighted include:
- costs, including the cost of the development and any ongoing costs, the risks and benefits including how you have mitigated against the risks
- the order and timing of tasks including any milestones, serial/concurrent and dependent tasks and contingency time
- selection and allocation of resources, for example the development team members and any physical resources required
