# Task 4a - Developing a solution

Task 4a will require you to develop a solution. The requirements of the additional functionality to the solution you designed and manipulated in [Task 3](/esp/task-3) will be given to you. The brief for this exam will also typically provide you with extra system and user requirements. Whilst coding it is worth checking back to these requirements to make sure that you have not deviated away from them. According to the textbook, you will usually be provided with a data file which can be used to test your solution.

Unlike the first three exams, this one is 4 hours long and the longest in this set.

| Requirements | Marks | "Competencies covered" |
| :----------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| Functionality | 6 | |
| Logic and programming structures | 3 | |
| Robustness | 3 | |
| Security | 6 | |
| Code organisation | 8 | M10 |
| User experience | 8 | E6 |

When creating your coded solution, you must:
- consider the security requirements and use secure coding principles and practices to mitigate against potential threats and vulnerabilities
- ensure your code is maintainable, readable and functional, and follows accepted programming conventions

During the exam, **you will not be required to produce formal evidence that you've tested your code** unlike in Task 2. However to ensure that the code meets the specified system and user requirements you should probably test the code as you write it.

## Things you should remember
General things:
- Make sure you only open the folder you are working on in VS Code Explorer
- Read the instructions very carefully, do not start work until you know exactly what is required
- Read the data file carefully, make sure you can read all column headings, and that you know what the data represents
- Look through the code you are given – there is probably code here you can use e.g. importing, reading a CSV etc, check how they have formatted outputs and do similar in your own work

Once you've started coding:
- One thing our teacher has suggested is that you should "start each part of the work in a new file", I'm guessing by this he means that if you're starting work on a new function or something similar you should create a new file for it so that it is easier to catch errors and determine where they are much quicker. However, if you do you this method you need to remember to **save and submit every file you created**.
- **# Comment everything** - commenting helps the examiner to figure out what you're doing and also what your intentions were if a certain bit of code doesn't work. By doing this you're essentially having a conversation with the examiner, helping them through your program.
- To check things, print() as you go along, when happy, comment out and leave for examiner to see.
- **If you get a Key Error, check date formatting e.g., change 2022 to 22 or vice versa.**
- When outputting information, use similar formatting to the code you have been given – **don’t forget you get marked on presentation**.
- If you cannot do exactly what you have been asked to do – well, what can you do?  At least do something, even if it is not exactly what they asked for as this will evidence understanding for which you should get some marks. For example, if you cannot plot data using MatPlotLib, print() instead, using comments to explain what you’ve done.

## Elanp Air - November 2022
For this section I'm going to be referring to a Task 4a example from November 2022 about "Elanp Air". The data file given in this exam is about departures and arrivals to and from different airports. You can view all files for this on the [Past Papers page](/past-papers#november-2022).

### Importing libraries
For this exam we needed 3 libraries, [Pandas](), [Matplotlib](), and [Numpy]().

```python
import pandas as pd # pandas referred to as pd throughout program
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # matplotlib referred to as plt
import numpy as np # numpy referred to as np
```

### Code snippets
Reading a datafile using pandas:
```python
df = pd.read_csv('Task4a_data_November-22.csv')
# accesses all data inside the csv and stores it as a variable called "df" (dataframe)

# if you want to read an Excel file, use:
df = pd.read_excel('Task4a_data_November-22.xlsx')
```

Extracting specific data from the dataframe:
```python
NAME_df = df[df["COLUMN NAME"] == "CRITERIA"]
```

```python
dub_df = df[df["From"] == "DUB"] # extract from "DUB" only from the dataframe and store the data in a variable called "dub_df"
```

To select against multiple columns and criteria:
```python
twoOnly = df[(df["COLUMN"] == "CRITERIA") & (df["COLUMN2"] == "CRITERIA2")
```

Creating a virtual column (not actually in the dataframe) from a sum of the other columns:
```python
df["Total Passengers"] = df["01/04/2022"] + df["02/04/2022"] + df["03/04/2022"] + df["04/04/2022"]
# creates 'virtual' column called "Total Passengers" which is the sum of each row left to right
# to confirm this we can print "Total Passengers" column ->

print(df["Total Passengers"]) # print to check this works, then comment out
```

Store all data based on a specific criteria from a specific column heading into a variable:
```python
dub_df = df[df["From"] == "DUB"] # extract From DUB only from df, store in dub_df

print(dub_df) # print to check this works, then comment out
```

Sum up a total:
```python
dub_df_passenger_count = dub_df["Total Passengers"].sum()
# print(dub_df_passenger_count)

print ("Total for Dublin = ", dub_df_passenger_count)
```

**These next code snippets are relating to a different exam from June 2022** about a housing company called Newhaven as they were the only examples I could find. You can find the details on this section of that exam on the [Past Papers page](/past-papers#june-2022) aswell.

Creating a bar graph using X and Y labels including labels:
```python
x = np.array(["Bungalows", "Semis", "Detached"])
y = np.array([bung_df_increase_count , semi_df_increase_count, det_df_increase_count])
plt.title("Sum of % Increase")
plt.xlabel("Property Type")
plt.ylabel("% Increase")
plt.grid()
plt.bar(x,y)
plt.show()
```

Working out an average of a range of figures, **using mean()** rather than sum():
```python
lon_df_av_increase = lon_df["Total % Increase"].mean()
# print(lon_df_av_increase)
```

Your final code must:
- be well-structured including the use of modules with a defined structure (for example, the use of procedures, funtions, or classes)
- have clear annotation to enable future maintenance
- use sensible and appropriate naming of all variables and structures

Your code should also meet the defined user requirements. This could be demonstrated by the inclusion of:
- user input handling (like the use of validation)
- user guidance and error messages
- outputs that meet the specified requirements, the user's needs and that are fit for purpose
