# Task 3 - Designing a solution

Task 3 focuses on designing a solution to a given set of requirements and the specified required outcomes. In the exam you have to produce algorithm(s) which meet the defined user requirements. You will also be told which types of tools are acceptable to produce your algorithm(s) in the brief. There is only one main requirement for this task/exam which is "algorithm design(s)".

Just the same as the last two tasks, you are given 3 hours to complete this exam.

| Requirements | Marks | "Competencies covered" |
| :----------- | :---- | :--------------------- |
| Decomposition of the problem | 8 | D4 |
| Application of logical thinking and conventions | 6 | M2, D2, E3 |
| Communication of the design | 3 | E4, D3 |

## Decomposition of the problem
When you are decomposing the problem you should:
- break down the problem into smaller parts, justifying any decisions made, and use decomposition to show all the necessary subsystems that make up the main solution
- use elements of reusable components
- visualise the decomposition using appropriate tools to communicate algorithms (flowcharts/pseudocode)

## Application of logical thinking
You also need to demonstrate that you can apply logical thinking by:
- describing the parts of the solution using algorithms, justifying how these algorithms form a complete solution to the problem
- clearly and uniquely defining the steps - each step should depend on the input and the result of the preceding steps
- ensuring the algorithm makes use of key constructs (like sequence, selection, and iteration)

## Use of conventions and communication of the design
It is important that you should consider and use relevant conventions, and make sure that the design documents contain a high level of detail. This will include:
- the correct use of structure and convention based on your selected algorithmic designs (I prefer flowcharts). For example, the correct and consistent use of symbols.
- the selection and consistent use of appropriate naming conventions throughout. This includes using sensible names and keywords. The names you choose can't be too confusing as they need to be easily understood by the examiner.
- the effective communication of your proposed solution which will allow the client to make informed decisions and enable a third party to use your design documents to create the proposed solution.

When you are creating your algorithmic designs (flowchart or pseudocode) you should also consider appropriate use of technical vocabulary, the audience, and explanations of structures and process in the design
