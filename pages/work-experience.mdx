# 315 hours of Work Experience
In order to pass the course it's required that you complete 315 hours (roughtly 45 days) of industry related work experience. Not all of this has to be on-site however as you are able to complete up to 100 hours via remote work.

The most difficult part of this work experience is actually finding it in the first place. From my experience (and that of people in my class), it's very unappealing for companies to take on T-Level students for a few reasons. One of these is that the students have little to no previous experience which makes it harder to get them involved with already established teams of professionals. 45 days is also an annoying timeframe as it's significant enough that there will always need to be work planned out for them, but not long enough that all this work is guaranteed to be completed (let alone to a good standard).

However, the people managing the course are actually quite leniant with the term "industry-related". I know people who have landed positions like social media management for companies/organisations that are not in the tech or engineering sector.
