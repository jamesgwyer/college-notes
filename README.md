# My college notes for "T-Level Technical Qualification in Digital Production, Design and Development"
I made this site to try and gather as many resources for this course as possible in one place because the exam board give out little to no helpful resources.

(and also because [this spec document from Pearson](https://qualifications.pearson.com/content/dam/pdf/TLevels/digital/2020/specification-and-sample-assessments/t-level-tq-in-digital-production-design-and-development-spec1.pdf) is really big and boring)

### To-do list
- [ ] add pages for "Occupational specialism" section (the 67 hour exam)
- [ ] find past papers to add to the site

### Forking this project
This site uses a template for creating documentation with [Nextra](https://nextra.site).

#### After downloading the repo locally
First, run `pnpm i` to install the dependencies.

Then, run `pnpm dev` to start the development server and visit localhost:3000.
